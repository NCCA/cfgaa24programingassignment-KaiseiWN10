# Kaisei Wieczorek-Numao (s5507922) - Particle-based fluid simulation - Computing for Graphics and Animation 23/24

For this project, I have computed a particle-based fluid simulation in C++ utilising the NGL library, offering an efficient simulation framework. This process involved exploring the underlying principles of fluid dynamics including the use of the Navier-Stokes equation to devise an algorithm to model interactions between particles and external forces such as gravity..

* Assign variables to each particle
